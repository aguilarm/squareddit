# Squareddit

Decided to have a go at using the Reddit API and Angular to make a web application.

Originally, I had kind of a showerthought that having reddit posts displayed as a grid of images would be pretty cool
so I made this.  That is done on the most basic level, but I plan on extending functionality to make sort of a
mini-reddit with most of the same features as the regular site.

Currently, this project is only hosted on Cloud9 for development,
you may be able to find a live demo <a href="http://squareddit-c9-aguilarm.c9.io/">here</a>.
More than likely you'll find an active development version there, so be aware of that.

##Building

If you're looking to build this guy locally, you'll need to add /config/secret.js with Reddit credentials for an app
associated with your account.

Here are some snapshots of recent progress:
