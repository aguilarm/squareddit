# Squareddit

Decided to have a go at using the Reddit API and Angular to make a web application.

Originally, I had kind of a showerthought that having reddit posts displayed as a grid of images would be pretty cool so I made this.
That is done on the most basic level, but I plan on extending functionality to make sort of a mini-reddit with most of the same features as the regular site.

Here are some snapshots of recent progress:
